Final Fantasy XIV Priority Changer
=======

This project is outdated and no longer being maintained
-----------------------------------------------------------
I made this for a friend that wanted to run FFXIV at a different process priority than normal. 
The game would always change the priority back to normal when it detected a priority change. 
This program will ensure that the priority be switched back to the desired setting.
